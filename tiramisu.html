   <h1>TIRAMISU</h1>
   <p>Tiramisu, which translates to “pick me up” in Italian, is a famous dessert believed to have originated in the Veneto region of Italy. Its name reflects its energizing ingredients, including coffee and cocoa. The exact origins are debated, but most agree it was developed in the 1960s or 1970s.<br>

    A popular claim is that it was created in the Le Beccherie restaurant in Treviso by pastry chef Roberto Linguanotto, possibly as a modern reinterpretation of older desserts like zabaione or coffee-based layered cakes. Over time, tiramisu gained worldwide fame, becoming a symbol of Italian desserts.</p>

   <h3>Tips for Perfect Tiramisu</h3>
   <img class ="three" src ="tiramisu3.jpg" alt ="Tiramisu">
   <ol>
    <li style ="font-weight: bold">Use High-Quality Ingredients:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Choose authentic Italian mascarpone, fresh eggs, and real espresso for the best flavor.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li style ="font-weight: bold">Don’t Oversoak the Ladyfingers:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Dip the biscuits quickly in the coffee mixture to avoid a soggy texture.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li style ="font-weight: bold">Chill Well:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Tiramisu improves with time. Allowing it to chill overnight deepens the flavors and ensures a firm consistency.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li style ="font-weight: bold">Stabilize the Cream:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>If you’re worried about the cream being too soft, add a teaspoon of gelatin dissolved in warm water to the mascarpone mixture.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li style ="font-weight: bold">Non-Alcoholic Version:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Skip the liqueur and add a little vanilla extract to the mascarpone cream for a family-friendly dessert.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li style ="font-weight: bold">Experiment with Layers:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Add a layer of grated dark chocolate or sprinkle crushed nuts between the layers for added texture and flavor.</li>
	  </ul>
   </ol>
