    <h1>Financiers</h1>
	<p>Financiers are small, buttery almond cakes with a distinctive light and crisp texture. Shaped like bars of gold, they’re known for their rich, nutty flavor and moist interior. Financiers are adored for their simplicity, refined taste, and versatility, often served with tea or as a light dessert.</p>
   </section>   
   <section class ="history">
    <h1>History of Financiers</h1>
    <p>The origins of Financiers date back to 17th-century France, where a similar almond-based cake called visitandines was popular among nuns in the Order of the Visitation. However, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that Financiers as we know them today were created. The story goes that a Parisian pastry chef named Lasne, whose shop was near the Paris Stock Exchange, adapted the recipe to create a small, dense, almond cake that would appeal to the busy financiers and stockbrokers nearby. He designed the cake to be convenient to eat on the go without causing crumbs. Its iconic rectangular shape, resembling a gold bar, is a nod to this connection with the financial district.</p>

    <h1>Financier Recipe</h1>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul class ="a2" style ="list-style-type: square">
	  <li>1/2 cup (60 g) almond flour</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup (60 g) all-purpose flour</li>
	  <li>3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar</li>
	  <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, browned</li>
	  <li>4 large egg whites</li>
	  <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	  <li>Optional: berries, nuts, or sliced fruit for garnish</li>
	</ul>
   </section>   
   <section class ="instruction">
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
	<ol>
	  <li class ="a1">Prepare the Browned Butter:</li>
	    <ul class ="a2">
		  <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns a golden-brown color and releases a nutty aroma. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Make the Batter:</li>
	    <ul class ="a2">
		  <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a financier or mini-muffin pan.</li>
		  <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together almond flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
		  <li>In a separate bowl, lightly beat the egg whites until frothy, but not stiff. Add the egg whites to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
		  <li>Gradually fold in the browned butter and vanilla extract until the batter is smooth.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Fill the Molds:</li>
	    <ul class ="a2">
		  <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared molds, filling each about 2/3 full.</li>
		  <li>Add a garnish if desired, such as a raspberry, blueberry, or almond slice on top of each.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Bake:</li>
	    <ul class ="a2">
		  <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean. Financiers should have a light, golden color and a slightly crisp edge.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Cool and Serve:</li>
	    <ul class ="a2">
		  <li>Let cool for a few minutes in the pan before transferring to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ul>		
	</ol>

    <h1>Tips for Perfect Financiers</h1>
	<ol>
	  <li class ="a1">Use Browned Butter:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li class ="a2">Browning the butter adds a rich, nutty flavor that enhances the taste of Financiers. Make sure to watch the butter closely as it browns to avoid burning.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Almond Flour Quality:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li class ="a2">For a delicate texture, use finely ground almond flour or make your own by pulsing blanched almonds in a food processor.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Egg Whites Only:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li class ="a2">Stick to egg whites without whipping to a stiff consistency. Lightly frothing them creates the classic lightness and structure of Financiers.</li>
        </ul>		
	  <li class ="a1">Optional Add-Ins:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li class ="a2">For a twist, try incorporating a small piece of fruit, chocolate, or nut into each Financier. Blueberries, raspberries, or chocolate chunks work well.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Avoid Overmixing:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li class ="a2">Mix the ingredients just until combined for a tender, moist texture.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Use Financier Molds:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li class ="a2">Traditionally, rectangular molds are used, but muffin or mini loaf molds work well as substitutes if necessary.</li>
		</ul>

    <h1>Best Season to Bake Financiers</h1>
	<p>Financiers are year-round treats but are particularly delightful during spring and summer, especially when fresh berries and stone fruits are in season and can be added as toppings. They’re often enjoyed with tea in the spring, while their light texture makes them a refreshing dessert option in the summer. For the fall and winter, Financiers are equally lovely with seasonal touches like sliced apples, pears, or a hint of spice, making them versatile enough to be enjoyed in all seasons.</p>
