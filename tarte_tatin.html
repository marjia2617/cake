    <p>Tarte Tatin is a famous French upside-down caramelized apple tart with a rich history that lends it a special charm.

	  <h2>History of Tarte Tatin</h2>
	  <p class ="a1">The Tarte Tatin was accidentally created in the 1880s by the Tatin sisters, Stéphanie and Caroline, who ran the Hotel Tatin in Lamotte-Beuvron, a small town south of Paris. The story goes that one day, Stéphanie was making a traditional apple pie but accidentally left the apples cooking in butter and sugar for too long. In an effort to save the dish, she placed the pastry dough over the caramelized apples and baked it. When inverted onto a serving plate, the tart was a delightful surprise, with the apples beautifully caramelized. It became a signature dish at their hotel and quickly gained popularity in Paris and beyond.</p>
	  <footer>Today, the Tarte Tatin is a beloved French dessert, celebrated for its simplicity and rich, caramelized flavor.</footer>

    <h1>Tarte Tatin Recipe</h1>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>6-8 medium-sized firm apples (such as Granny Smith or Golden Delicious), peeled, cored, and halved.</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar.</li>
	  <li>1/4 cup (60 g) unsalted butter.</li>
	  <li>1 sheet of puff pastry (store-bought or homemade) or 9-inch shortcrust pastry.</li>
	  <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional, to prevent browning)</li>
	  <li>Optional: pinch of cinnamon or vanilla extract</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Prepare the Apples:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
		<li>Peel, core, and halve the apples. To keep them from browning, toss them with a little lemon juice if desired.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <li style ="font-weight: bold">Make the Caramel:</li>
      <ul>
	    <li>In an oven-safe skillet or cast-iron pan (about 9-10 inches), melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the butter.</li>
		<li>Allow the sugar to melt and caramelize without stirring too much. Swirl the pan gently to help the caramel develop evenly. This should take about 5-7 minutes until it’s a deep amber color.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <li style ="font-weight: bold">Arrange the Apples:</li>
      <ul>
	    <li>Carefully place the apple halves, rounded side down, into the caramel in a circular pattern, tightly packed. Cook the apples in the caramel for about 5-10 minutes on the stovetop, turning occasionally to ensure they’re evenly coated.</li>
      </ul><br> 
      <li style ="font-weight: bold">Add the Pastry:</li>
      <ul>
	    <li>Roll out the pastry to a circle slightly larger than the skillet. Drape the pastry over the apples, tucking the edges down around the apples.</li>
		<li>Use a knife to cut a few small slits in the pastry to allow steam to escape.</li>
      </ul><br>	
      <li style ="font-weight: bold">Bake the Tarte Tatin:</li>	  
	  <ul>
	    <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Invert the Tarte:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Allow the tart to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then carefully run a knife around the edge to loosen.</li>
		<li>Place a large serving plate over the skillet and, using oven mitts, invert the skillet so the tart releases onto the plate.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Serve:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Serve warm, ideally with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
	  </ul>
	</ol>

    <h2>Tips for Making Tarte Tatin</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Choose the Right Apples:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Use firm apples that hold their shape well, like Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or Braeburn. Softer apples can break down and become mushy.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Perfect the Caramel:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Be patient when making the caramel. Don’t stir too much, as it can cause crystallization. Swirl the pan gently instead. Aim for a deep amber color for a rich, intense flavor.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Use an Oven-Safe Skillet:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>A cast-iron skillet works perfectly for Tarte Tatin as it distributes heat evenly and is oven-safe. The caramel develops beautifully in cast iron.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Avoid Burning the Caramel:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Keep a close eye on the caramel while it cooks, as it can burn quickly. The caramel should be deep but not burnt, which can add bitterness.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Tuck in the Pastry:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>When placing the pastry over the apples, make sure to tuck it in around the edges to encase the apples. This helps the crust bake evenly.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Invert Carefully:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>When turning out the Tarte Tatin, be very careful. Hot caramel can spill, so use oven mitts and hold the skillet firmly against the plate.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Serve Fresh:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Tarte Tatin is best served shortly after it’s made while it’s still warm and the caramel is glossy.</li>
	  </ul><br>
	  <li style ="font-weight: bold">Experiment with Flavors:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>While the traditional Tarte Tatin is simple, you can add a sprinkle of cinnamon, a touch of vanilla, or even a splash of brandy to the caramel for extra depth.</li>
	  </ul><br>
