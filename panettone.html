    <h1 style ="text-align: center">PANETTONE</h1>
	<h2>History of Panettone</h2>
	<p>Panettone is a tall, fluffy, and sweet bread that originates from Milan, Italy. Its history dates back to the Middle Ages, but the modern version likely evolved in the 15th or 16th century.

    One legend attributes its creation to a Milanese baker named Toni, who accidentally created the bread while attempting a special dessert. This "Pan de Toni" became known as panettone. Another version credits it to a nobleman, Ughetto degli Atellani, who disguised himself as a baker to win the love of a baker's daughter.

    Panettone gained wider popularity in the 20th century, when industrial production allowed it to be distributed widely across Italy and eventually the world. Today, it is synonymous with Christmas and New Year celebrations, often shared among family and friends.</p>
	
	<h2>Traditional Panettone Recipe</h2>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li class = "a1">For the Dough (Starter):</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour</li>
		  <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) water</li>
		  <li>1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">For the Main Dough:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>3 1/2 cups (420 g) all-purpose flour</li>
		  <li>1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar</li>
		  <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) warm milk</li>
		  <li>2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
		  <li>1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
		  <li>3 large eggs</li>
		  <li>1 egg yolk</li>
		  <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
		  <li>Zest of 1 orange and 1 lemon</li>
		  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">For the Filling:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>3/4 cup (120 g) candied orange peel</li>
		  <li>1/2 cup (75 g) raisins (soaked in rum or water)</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">For Topping:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>2 tbsp pearl sugar (optional)</li>
		  <li>Sliced almonds (optional)</li>
		</ul>
  	  
	</ul>
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li class ="a1">Prepare the Starter:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Mix the starter ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and let rest for 4-6 hours or overnight until bubbly and doubled.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Make the Dough:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
		  <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the starter, flour, sugar, butter, eggs, egg yolk, vanilla extract, zest, and salt. Knead until a smooth dough forms, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Incorporate the Filling:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Knead in the soaked raisins and candied orange peel. Shape the dough into a ball.</li>
        </ul>		
	  <li class ="a1">First Rise:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 2-3 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Shape and Second Rise:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Punch down the dough and shape it into a ball. Place it in a panettone mold or a parchment-lined tall baking tin. Let it rise again for 2-3 hours.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Bake the Panettone:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the top with an egg wash and sprinkle with pearl sugar or almonds if desired.</li>
		  <li>Bake for 40-50 minutes. Check after 30 minutes and cover with foil if browning too quickly.</li>
		  <li>Let cool completely before slicing.</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<h3>Tips for Making Perfect Panettone</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li class ="a1">Be Patient with Rising:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Panettone is a slow-rising bread. Allow adequate time for fermentation to develop flavor and achieve its characteristic fluffy texture.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Use Strong Flour:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>A high-protein flour (bread flour) helps develop the gluten necessary for its airy structure.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Incorporate Air into the Dough:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Knead thoroughly until the dough is elastic and passes the “windowpane test” (stretches thin without tearing).</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Soak the Raisins:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Soak dried fruits in rum, orange juice, or water for extra moisture and flavor.</li>
        </ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Mold Alternatives:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>If you don’t have a panettone mold, use a deep cake tin lined with parchment paper, extending above the rim.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Cool Upside Down:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>After baking, cool the panettone upside down using skewers to prevent it from collapsing and maintain its airy texture.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Customize Fillings:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Experiment with chocolate chips, nuts, or different dried fruits to suit your taste.</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<h3>Best Season to Bake Panettone</h3>
	<p>Panettone is traditionally baked and enjoyed during the Christmas and New Year holidays, making it a symbol of Italian festive celebrations. Its rich ingredients and warming flavors, like citrus and dried fruits, perfectly complement the winter season. However, it’s also great for special occasions or as a luxurious treat year-round.</p>
