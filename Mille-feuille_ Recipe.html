	<h1>Instructions</h1><br>
	<h2 style ="text-align: center">Prepare the Puff Pastry</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
	  <li>Roll out the puff pastry to about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick and trim the edges to create a neat rectangle. Transfer the pastry to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
	  <li>Prick the entire surface of the puff pastry with a fork to prevent it from puffing up too much during baking.</li>
	  <li>Place another sheet of parchment paper on top of the puff pastry and weigh it down with another baking sheet or a heavy pan (to ensure it stays flat).</li>
	  <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove the top baking sheet and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes to let the pastry crisp up.</li>
	  <li>Once baked, let the pastry cool, and then cut it into three equal rectangles.</li>
	</ol>

	<section>
	<h2 style ="text-align: center">Make the Pastry Cream</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla over medium heat until just boiling. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
	  <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch until pale and smooth.</li>
	  <li>Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture while whisking continuously to temper the eggs.</li>
	  <li>Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
	  <li>Remove from heat, whisk in the butter, and transfer the pastry cream to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap touching the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Let it cool completely in the fridge.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 style ="text-align: center">Assemble the Mille-Feuille</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>Place one layer of baked puff pastry on a serving plate.</li>
	  <li>Spread half of the pastry cream evenly over the pastry.</li>
	  <li>Place the second layer of puff pastry on top and spread the remaining pastry cream.</li>
	  <li>Top with the third layer of puff pastry.</li>
	</ol>

	<section>
	<h2 style ="text-align: center">Prepare the Icing</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>In a small bowl, mix the powdered sugar with enough water to create a smooth, spreadable glaze.</li>
	  <li>Melt the dark chocolate and transfer it to a piping bag (or a small plastic bag with the tip cut off).</li>
	  <li>Spread the white icing over the top layer of the puff pastry.</li>
	  <li>Pipe thin parallel lines of chocolate across the icing, then use a toothpick to drag through the chocolate lines in alternating directions to create a feathered pattern.</li>
	</ol>

	<section>
	<h2 style ="text-align: center">Chill and Serve</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>Refrigerate the assembled Mille-Feuille for at least 1 hour to allow the pastry cream to set and the flavors to meld.</li>
	  <li>When ready to serve, use a sharp knife to carefully slice into portions.</li>
	</ol>
