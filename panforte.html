    <h1>History of Panforte</h1>
	<img src ="panforte1.jpg" alt ="panforte">
     <p>Panforte, meaning "strong bread," is a dense, chewy Italian dessert originating in Siena, Tuscany. Its history dates back to at least the 13th century, where it was initially prepared by monks and nuns for religious ceremonies and as a gift for nobility.<br>

     Early versions were simpler, made with honey, flour, and dried fruits, and were considered a luxury due to the scarcity of exotic ingredients like spices and nuts. Over time, as trade routes expanded, Panforte began incorporating spices such as cinnamon and cloves, which earned it the nickname Panpepato (peppered bread).<br>

     Panforte remains a traditional holiday treat in Italy, often associated with Christmas. Its long shelf life made it a valuable travel food, and today it is a symbol of Tuscan culinary heritage.</p>

		<li>2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp ground cloves</li>
		<li>Pinch of salt</li>
	  </ul>
	<li class ="a1">Wet Ingredients:</li>
      <ul>
	    <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) honey</li>
		<li>1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar</li>
      </ul>  
    <li class ="a1">For Topping:</li>	  
	  <ul>
	    <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
      </ul>	  
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li class ="a1">Prepare the Ingredients:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease and line an 8-inch (20 cm) round pan with parchment paper.</li>
		<li>Toast the nuts lightly in the oven or on the stovetop and chop coarsely. Mix with candied fruits, flour, cocoa powder, spices, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li class ="a1">Make the Syrup:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>In a small saucepan, heat the honey and sugar over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and cook for 1-2 minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li class ="a1">Combine:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Pour the hot syrup over the dry ingredients. Mix quickly and thoroughly until the mixture is sticky and evenly combined.<li>

	<li class ="a1">Bake:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Press the mixture into the prepared pan using a spatula or wet hands to flatten it evenly. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the edges are slightly firm. Do not overbake, as it should remain chewy.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li class ="a1">Cool and Serve:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Let the panforte cool in the pan. Dust generously with powdered sugar before slicing into thin wedges.</li>
