    <h1>Madeleines</h1>
	<p>Madeleines are small, shell-shaped French cakes known for their distinctive shape, buttery flavor, and light, spongy texture. They’re often associated with French tea time and have a rich cultural and culinary history.</p>

    <h1>History of Madeleines</h1>
	<img src ="madeleines2.jpg" alt ="madeleines">
	<p>The exact origin of Madeleines is somewhat debated, but the most popular story dates back to the 18th century in the French town of Commercy in Lorraine. It is believed that a young servant named Madeleine Paulmier created these little cakes to impress the guests of Stanisław Leszczyński, the Duke of Lorraine and exiled King of Poland. The Duke was so impressed that he named the cakes after her.<br>

    Later, Stanisław’s daughter, Queen Marie of France, brought the recipe to the French court, where Madeleines quickly gained popularity. The cakes are also famously linked to the writer Marcel Proust, whose descriptions of eating a Madeleine in In Search of Lost Time elevated them to a symbol of nostalgia and memory in French culture.</p>

    <h1>Madeleine Recipe</h1>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar</li>
	  <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
	  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or lemon zest for variation)</li>
	  <li>3/4 cup (95 g) all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
	  <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	  <li>1/4 cup (60 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
	  <li>A pinch of salt</li>
	  <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li class ="a1">Prepare the Batter:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light, thick, and pale, about 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Add vanilla extract (or lemon zest, if using) and beat until combined.</li>
		<li>Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together, then gently fold them into the egg mixture until just combined.</li>
		<li>Gradually fold in the melted butter until the batter is smooth and no streaks remain. Avoid overmixing to keep the batter light.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Chill the Batter:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Cover the batter and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight. Chilling helps develop the characteristic hump of the Madeleine.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pan:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
		<li>Grease and flour a Madeleine pan to ensure the cakes release easily.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Bake the Madeleines:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Spoon the batter into each shell of the prepared Madeleine pan, filling about 3/4 full.</li>
		<li>Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden and a small hump forms in the center. Madeleines should spring back when lightly pressed.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Cool and Dust:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Allow the Madeleines to cool for a few minutes in the pan, then gently remove them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
		<li>Dust with powdered sugar before serving, if desired.</li>
      </ul>		  
	</ol>

    <h1>Tips for Making Perfect Madeleines</h1>
	<ol>
	  <li class ="a1">Chill the Batter and Pan:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Chilling the batter is essential to achieving the signature “hump” in the Madeleines. You can also place the Madeleine pan in the freezer for a few minutes before filling it to further encourage the rise.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Use a Madeleines Pan:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>A proper Madeleine pan is crucial for the authentic shell shape. Make sure to grease and flour the pan well, as Madeleines are delicate and can stick.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Beat the Eggs Well:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Beating the eggs with sugar until they’re light and fluffy creates volume, giving the Madeleines their airy texture. This step is crucial for light, fluffy cakes.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Fold Gently:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>When adding flour and melted butter, fold gently to retain the air in the batter. Overmixing can deflate the batter and result in dense Madeleines.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Avoid Overfilling:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Fill each shell only about 3/4 full. Overfilling can cause the batter to spread too much, which may prevent the Madeleines from developing their characteristic hump.</li>
        </ul>		
	  <li class ="a1">Use Quality Ingredients:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Since Madeleines have simple ingredients, using good-quality butter, fresh eggs, and real vanilla extract (or lemon zest) will make a big difference in the flavor.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Watch the Baking Time:</li>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Madeleines bake quickly, so keep a close eye on them. They’re done when the edges turn golden and they spring back when lightly touched.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li class ="a1">Serve Fresh:</li>	
	    <ul>
		  <li>Madeleines are best enjoyed fresh, ideally on the same day they’re made. Their delicate texture and flavor diminish quickly, so savor them while they’re warm and tender.</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<footer>
	  <p>Enjoying Madeleines fresh with a dusting of powdered sugar and perhaps a cup of tea is a lovely nod to French tradition, showcasing their delicate texture and delicious flavor.</p>
